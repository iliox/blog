# Hello World!

Welcome to my personal blog! I'm excited to finally have a space to share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings in the world of technology, machine learning, and AI.

## Who Am I?

I'm Nishant Thakur, a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Coinbase, where I work on building intelligent AI systems that make a real impact. With a background from IIT Kharagpur and experience spanning multiple companies, I've had the privilege of working on some exciting projects that combine cutting-edge AI with practical applications.

## Why This Blog?

Over the years, I've learned a lot from the tech community - through blog posts, tutorials, open-source projects, and countless Stack Overflow answers. This blog is my way of giving back and sharing what I've learned along the way.

Here's what you can expect from this space:

### Technical Deep Dives
I'll be sharing insights from my work with:
- **LLMs and Agentic AI**: Building autonomous AI agents using LangGraph, ADK, and MCP
- **Machine Learning at Scale**: Lessons learned from deploying ML systems that impact millions of users
- **Optimization Techniques**: Applying my academic background in optimization theory to real-world problems

### Project Showcases
I love building things! From hackathon projects to production systems, I'll share:
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Code snippets and implementation details
- Lessons learned from failures and successes

### Career and Learning
Navigating the tech industry, especially in AI/ML, can be challenging. I'll share:
- Career tips and insights
- Learning resources that have helped me
- Thoughts on the evolving landscape of AI

## What's Next?

I have a backlog of topics I'm excited to write about:
- Building conversation engines with LLMs
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) best practices
- From research to production: deploying ML models at scale
- My journey from Biotechnology to Machine Learning
